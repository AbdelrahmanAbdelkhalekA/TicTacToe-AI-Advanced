# TicTacToe-AI-Advanced
This project is an implementation of an `TicTacToe` game using `Java` and `Java swing` where the user has the option to play with a friend or the computer. The project can also be customized to function for more than 3 grib by grid as the user wish (it is not available on my gitHub but you can email me: a description will be down below for how it is approached). 

## TicTacToeIn.java:
This is where most of all the classes and sub classes run.
